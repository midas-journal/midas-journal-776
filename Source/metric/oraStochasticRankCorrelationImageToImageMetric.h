/** \class StochasticRankCorrelationImageToImageMetric
 * \brief An implementation of Stochastic Rank Correlation (SRC) metric.
 *
 * An ITK-based implementation of Stochastic Rank Correlation (SRC) metric for
 * image registration as proposed by Birkfellner et al. <br><br>
 * <i>Birkfellner W, Stock M, Figl M, Gendrin C, Hummel J, Dong S, Kettenbach J,
 * Georg D, Bergmann H.: Stochastic rank correlation: a robust merit function
 * for 2D/3D registration of image data obtained at different energies.
 * Med Phys. 2009; 36(8): 3420-3428</i>.
 *
 * In contrast to cross-correlation (Pearson's product moment correlation
 * coefficient; linear relationship), this non-parametric metric assesses the
 * statistical relationship between 2 variables using a monotonic function. It
 * is the implementation of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. In order to
 * map the source images' intensities onto an ordinal scale, the intensity
 * histograms are extracted. Subsequently, an average rank (derived from the
 * cumulative histogram) is assigned to each bin, yielding an intensity (metric
 * scale) to rank (ordinal scale) lookup table. The word "stochastic" means that
 * only a subset of the image pixels is considered for histogram creation. Once
 * the lookup tables for the moving and the fixed image are determined, the
 * metric value M_SRC (rank correlation coefficient) is computed as follows:<br>
 * M_SRC = 6 * sum_1_to_N ( delta_I_N^2 ) / ( N * (N^2 - 1) ). <br>
 * N is the number of sampled pixels (defined on the fixed image grid) and
 * delta_I_N^2 denote the square differences of mapped fixed image pixel ranks
 * and moving image ranks.
 *
 * As can be seen from the formula above, this metric yields a MINIMIZATION
 * problem!
 *
 * Birkfellner et al. reported 5 % of the pixels of the fixed image (randomly
 * sampled) as a sufficient subset for 2D/3D registration of a spine reference
 * data set. The 'sample coverage' may however depend on the concrete field of
 * application.
 *
 * NOTE: In contrast to the approach presented by Birkfellner et al., this
 * implementation does not generate ranks by sampling and sorting the discrete
 * pixel intensities. It uses the generic ITK histogram implementation with
 * configurable minimum / maximum intensities and number of bins, and then
 * generates a simple 1D-histogram. The ranks are inherently derived by
 * generating the cumulative histogram "on the fly", and calculating the
 * "average rank" for each bin. Therefore, this approach works on input images
 * with an arbitrary (not necessarily ordinal) pixel type.
 *
 * Furthermore, this metric supports a fixed image region, and a fixed as well
 * as a moving image mask for measure evaluation.
 *
 * The stochastic factor (sample coverage) is either defined as percentage or as
 * user-specified mask input image (pixels > 0 define pixels to be considered).
 *
 * The cost function derivative is computed using finite distances (step-by-step
 * transform parameter perturbation). The derivative step length scales can be
 * set individually. This may for example be important to distinguish between
 * rotational and translational parameters.
 *
 * This class is templated over the fixed image type (TFixedImage),
 * the moving image type (TMovingImage), and the rank image type
 * (TRankImage). The input image dimension must equal the output image
 * dimension. The rank image pixel type must be large enough to cover the rank
 * range (i.e. the number of pixels found in the fixed / moving image in worst
 * case).
 *
 * NOTE: Changing fixed / moving histogram properties (minimum intensity,
 * maximum intensity, number of bins), the fixed image mask or the fixed image
 * region will show an effect AFTER calling Initialize()! Modifying one or more
 * of these properties without calling Initialize() won't have any impact!
 *
 * NOTE: Each call to Initialize() will internally generate a stochastic mask if
 * sample coverage (percentage) is used, or check (and potentially correct) the
 * user-specified input mask against fixed image region and mask otherwise. This
 * internal stochastic mask, which defines the sample pixels, can only be
 * retrieved during the AfterMaskCreation()-event using the GetStochasticMask()-
 * method.
 *
 * NOTE: Ranking of the fixed image during Initialize() is achieved by utilizing
 * a multi-threaded convenience filter (ora::AverageRanksImageToImageFilter).
 *
 * NOTE: At the moment, this metric generates a 'rank image representation' of
 * the fixed image which has the same number of pixels as the fixed image. This
 * image is kept until the object is destroyed or Initialize() is called once
 * again. Be aware of this additional memory requirement (may be relevant for
 * image registration with more than 2 dimensions)!
 *
 * NOTE: In order to correct for tied ranks, "Horn"-correction can be activated
 * (UseHornTiedRanksCorrection-flag).<br>
 * "D. Horn, A correction for the effect of tied ranks on the value of
 *   the rank difference correlation coefficient, Journal of Educational
 *   Psychology, Volume 33, Issue 9, December 1942, Pages 686-690."
 *
 * NOTE: Since a minimum/maximum intensity for histogram extraction (moving
 * AND fixed image) can be specified, some "mapped" (transformed and
 * interpolated) moving image pixel can effectively be assigned a 0-rank (e.g.
 * because they're outside the specified intensity range). The
 * MovingZeroRanksContributeToMeasure-flag controls whether these 0-ranks are
 * considered during computation of SRC coefficient (metric measure) or not.
 *
 * <b>Events:</b><br>
 * - <b>AfterMaskCreation</b>: fired right after stochastic mask creation
 * (according to configured sample coverage) or after check of user-specified
 * stochastic mask.<br>

 * this metric and on how to use it!
